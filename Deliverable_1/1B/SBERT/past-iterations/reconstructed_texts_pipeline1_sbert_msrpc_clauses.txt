Today is our dragon boat festival, in our Chinese culture, to celebrate it with all safe, great in 
our lives. Hope you too, to enjoy it as my deepest wishes. Thank your message to show our words to  the doctor, as his next contract checking, to all of us. I got this message to see the approved message. In fact, I have received the message from  the 
professor, to show me, this, a couple of days ago. I am very appreciated  the full support of the 
professor, for our Springer proceedings publication

During our final discuss, I told him about the new submission — the one we were waiting since 
last autumn, the updates was confusing as it not included the full feedback from reviewer, maybe editor? Anyway, I believe the team, although bit delay, less communication at recent days, they really 
tried best for paper, cooperation. We should be grateful, I mean all of us, for the acceptance 
and efforts until the Springer link came finally last week, I think. Also, kindly remind me please, if the doctor still plan for the acknowledgments section edit before 
he sending again. Because I didn’t see that part final yet, maybe I missed, I apologize if so. Overall, let us make sure all are safe, celebrate the outcome with strong coffee, future 
targets
